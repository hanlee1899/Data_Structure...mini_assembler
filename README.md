# **data-structure-mini-assembler**
## &ensp;Project while taking a data structure class

#### &emsp;*SIC* consists of 8 bits in one byte.
#### &emsp;All addresses are expressed and stored in bytes.
#### &emsp;3 consecutive bytes It is called a word, and the address is specified
#### &emsp;as the location of the lowest byte among the three bytes that make up the word.
#### &emsp;The total memory of the SIC is 2 to the 15th power.
#### &emsp;For more details, please refer to the following blog. <https://dev.youngkyu.kr/tag/RESW>
